## Timer Live Activity

This is an example project that illustrates how to architect the communication layer between a React Native application and an iOS Live Activity.

It showcases:
- üçè **Swift Native Module**: create the necessary bridging files to use the latest and greatest iOS language in your Native Modules
- üöÄ **Live Activity API**: start, update and stop an iOS Live Activity from React Native
- üñåÔ∏è **Swift UI**: examine the declarative Swift UI composition model
- :electron: **Bidirectional Communication**: invoke React Native code when an interaction happens within the live activity
